//! Defines types and interfaces that internal clients use to interact
//! with the core of DrMem. The primary, internal client is the
//! GraphQL interface, but asks in logic blocks also use this module.
//!
//! Any new, internal tasks that need access to device readings or
//! wish to set the value of the device need to have a
//! `client::RequestChan` handle. As DrMem starts, it should
//! `.clone()` the `RequestChan` used to communicate with the
//! back-end.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! async fn some_new_task(handle: client::RequestChan) {
//!    // Initialize and enter loop.
//!
//!    let device = "some:device".parse::<device::Name>().unwrap();
//!
//!    loop {
//!        // Set a device value.
//!
//!        if some_condition {
//!            handle.set_device(&device, true.into())
//!        }
//!    }
//! }
//!
//! // Somewhere in DrMem start-up.
//!
//! let task = some_new_task(backend_chan.clone());
//!
//! // Add the task to the set of tasks to be awaited.
//! ```
