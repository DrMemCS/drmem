The DrMem Project strives to be a complete, easy-to-use control system
for the hobbyist. This project is aimed at people that like to tinker
and build programmable systems. Although commercial products will be
supported, nothing prevents you from incorporating and controlling
your own custom hardware.

DrMem has been developed with the following design goals:

* **Reliability**. Excepting hardware failures, this control system
should provide 24/7 service in controlling and monitoring its devices.
Like any project of this type, careful design and extensive testing
will help prevent issues. However, DrMem is also written in the
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language which provides
strong compile-time checks which eliminate whole classes of bugs that
occur in other languages. This project is an experiment in writing
mission-critical code in Rust.

* **Efficiency**. Because we're using Rust, we have a systems
programming language which generates optimal code and reduces CPU
usage. Less CPU means reduced power consumption and less latency in
responding to hardware inputs. In this project, we're also using the
`tokio` async scheduler which means tasks will get distributed across
all cores of the system, further reducing latencies (or providing more
scalability.)

* **Simplicity**. DrMem is targeted for small installations so we want
to minimize the number services that need to be managed. The `drmemd`
executable, along with a configuration file that defines your
location's set of devices, is all you need. DrMem also lets you define
logic in its configuration so you don't need an external application
to peform control loops.

* **Accessibility**. Although DrMem is capable running in the
background with no user interaction, it is useful to have an interface
that applications can use to provide dashboards, etc. for viewing and
controlling DrMem devices. This is provided by a built-in HTTP
server hosting a GraphQL interface.

## What's Ready Now

Although DrMem is a young project, it's core is very usable. These are
currently supported features:

- Two types of back-end storage
  - A "simple" back-end which only saves the last value of a device
  - A back-end which writes device information to a Redis server
- A client API which uses GraphQL
- Drivers which implement devices
  - 5 built-in drivers
    - Memory devices
	- Cycling device
	- Timer device
    - Latch device
	- Map device (maps ranges of integers to values)
  - 4 external drivers
    - Weather Underground data
	- NTP daemon status
	- TP-Link support (tested with an HS440 Kasa light dimmer)
	- (Author's) custom sump pump monitor
- A "logic block" module that lets you define logic so that control loops
  can be set up internally, instead of requiring external client applications
  to do the controlling.

You can try some of this out by following the
[tutorial](doc/book/content/TUTORIAL.md).

## Other Control System / Home Automation Projects

If you're looking for more complete solutions that are available now,
here are a few options:

- [EPICS](https://epics-controls.org/) is a professional control system used
  by particle accelerators and observatories around the world.
- [Mister House](https://github.com/hollie/misterhouse) is a home
  automation system, written in Perl, that has been around for
  decades.
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) is a nice-looking,
  well-polished, home automation system.
- Many devices can also be controlled by [Google's Home app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app)
  or [Apple's HomeKit app](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/)

But be sure to check back occasionally as `drmem` matures!

## Colophon

The name of this project, DrMem, is a shortened version of "Doctor
Memory" -- a character from Firesign Theatre's comedy album, "We're
All Bozos on this Bus". Doctor Memory is the marginally intelligent,
easily confused AI that operates behind the scenes of the Future Fair.

Although this project strives to be much more reliable than this
fictional character, I wanted to pay homage to Firesign Theatre's
early vision of a powerful control system.
